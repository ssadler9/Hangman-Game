# Hangman-Game

Hello JavaScript!

Wow, this game was a real challenge, but very rewarding when it started working!

This is your Traditional Hangman Game.  The theme here is golf.  When you load the game, you will see two boxes appear in the center of your screen.  The box on the left will house the blank spaces to fill in.  Underneath that, you will see how many guesses you have remaining.  The guesses start at 9.

The box on the right will hold the letters you've already guessed.  Once you fill in the spaces, the Game Status will say "You Win!".  Unfortunately, the only way to play again is to refresh the page.  This page is still under construction!

Feel free to leave any comments if you see room to improve.
